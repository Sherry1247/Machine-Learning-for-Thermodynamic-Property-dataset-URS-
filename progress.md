## 2025-09-18 (First Meeting)
### What I planned
Reading virtual sensor essays (overview stage) \
Set up Python + GitHub repo \
Download JANAF CO₂ dataset (C-095.txt) \
Try first visualization (Cp vs T) \

## 2025-09-18 -- 2025-09-25 (Week1)
### What I did:
Created repo with README.md and progress.md
Added data/C-095.txt (CO₂ JANAF table)
Wrote script src/visualize_co2.py → successfully plotted Cp vs T
Learned how to commit + push files to GitHub
Explored multiple plots (Cp, S, ΔfH, ΔfG vs T)
Added second dataset data/C-093.txt for CO
Wrote script src/visualize_co_cp_vs_T.py → plotted Cp vs T for CO

### Problems/ Questions:
When plotting multiple properties on same axis, scales are different (Cp vs ΔfH). Should I normalize or use subplots?

### Next Step:
